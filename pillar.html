<p><font size=4> The event that impacted Ramasamy's life </br> 
<b>Kasi Pilgrimage Incident</b>
In 1904, E.V. Ramasamy went on a pilgrimage to Kasi to visit the revered Shiva temple of Kashi Vishwanath. Though regarded as one of the holiest sites of Hinduism, he witnessed immoral activities such as begging, and floating dead bodies. His frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in general when he experienced what he called Brahmanic exploitation.
However, one particular incident in Kasi had a profound impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries and monasteries  , which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.
As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar was forced to feed on leftovers from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. 
In the pilgrimage, he even saw a female beggar who was selling herself for food. He also found that the priests cheated the pilgrims of their money and did not perform  the religious rituals as required.
This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all.Ramasamy was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.</br>

Periyar after coming back to his home was given the full responsibility of managing and running the family business. Periyar began to help people out in many ways. Though he lacked formal education, he knew about law and its loopholes and weaknesses. Whenever a dispute occurred, he was the judge of it . If people wanted roads, they went to Periyar. He indulged in many activities to help his people .</br>

</b>FRIENDSHIP OF TAMIL SCHOLARS 1905-06 </b>:In his youthful years he was attracted by the Tamil scholar Pandithamani Ayothidhaasar who vehemently condemned the caste - system and Hindu religion of Brahmins with the principles of rationalism and Buddhism. There was a Tamil Scholar by name: PULAVAR MARUDHAIYA PILLAI at Karur. His logical arguments and daring condemnation of Hindu religion, caste-system, deceptive myths in the epics and Vedic shastras (Hindu Dogmas) spread by the Brahmins, had attracted admiration of even the ordinary rural people in the areas around Erode and Karur. His friendship played a major role in implanting atheism[no belief in God] firmly in the mind of Periyar.</br>
