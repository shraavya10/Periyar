<b>Anti-Brahmanism</b></br></br>
Periyar was a radical advocate of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is  often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism. 
Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun and stop supporting  brahmanism.</br>
In 1920, when the Justice Party came to power, Brahmins occupied about 70 percent of the high level posts in the government. After reservation was introduced by the Justice Party, it reversed that style, allowing non-Brahmins to rise in the government of the Madras Presidency.
Periyar who was a supporter of Non-Brahmins, questioned the dominance of Brahmins which had created an imbalance in the society. His Self-Respect Movement adopted rationalism and atheism and the movement  had adopted anti-Brahminism.</br></br>
<i>Periyar stated that:
"Our Dravidian movement does not exist against the Brahmins or the Banias (a North Indian merchant caste). If anyone thinks so, I would only pity him. But we will not tolerate the ways in which Brahmanism and the Bandiaism is degrading Dravidanadu. Whatever support they may have from the government, neither myself nor my movement will be of cowardice".</i></br></br>

<b>Atheism</b></br>

Periyar was generally regarded as a practical, down to earth sensible propagandist who attacked the evils of religious influence on society, mainly what he regarded as Brahmin domination. At a young age, he felt that some people used religion only  to deceive innocent people and regarded it as his life's mission to warn people against superstitions and priests. Priests cheated people of their money and did not perform  the religious rituals as required. 
<b><i>Periyar stated: "be of help to people. Do not use treachery or deceit. Speak the truth and do not cheat. That indeed is service to God."</br>
 
"…the talk of the atheist should be considered thoughtless and erroneous. The thing I call god... that makes all people equal and free, the god that does not stop free thinking and research, the god that does not ask for money, flattery and temples can certainly be an object of worship. For saying this much I have been called an atheist, a term that has no meaning".</br></b></i>
In Hinduism, Periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book or origins, but an imaginary faith preaching the "superiority" of the Brahmins, the inferiority of the Shudras, and the untouchability of the Dalits.</br>
In 1955 Periyar was arrested for his public action of burning pictures of Rama in public places as a symbolic protest against the Indo-Aryan domination and degradation of the Dravidian leadership according to the Ramayana epic. Periyar also shoed images of Krishna and Rama, stating that they were Aryan gods that considered the Dravidian Shudras to be "sons of prostitutes".</br></br>
 
<b>Women’s rights</b></br>
As a rationalist and a  social reformer, Periyar advocated throughout his life that women should be given their position in society as the equals of men and that they should be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs should not be restrictions  in marrying women. He wanted women to realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.Periyar fought against the orthodox traditions of marriage  women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian subcontinent.Arranged marriage was just a means to enslave women.Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed that it would be a sin to marry after puberty.Another practice, which is still prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents' wealth, and in certain circumstances, led to dowry deaths of many women.. Periyar fought against the abuse of women.
He criticised the hypocrisy of chastity for women and argued that it should either apply also to men, or not at all for both genders. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated getting rid of the Devadasi system where  parents marry their daughters to a deity or a temple. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women, attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others and as temple prostitutes. Further, for the liberation of women, Periyar pushed for their right to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.</br>

<b>Views on Tamil language</b></br>
Periyar claimed that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada came from the same mother language of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states.With relation to writing, Periyar stated that using the Tamil script about the arts, which are useful to the people in their life and  knowledge, talent and courage, will enlighten the people.Periyar also stated that if words of North Indian origin (Sanskrit) are removed from Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, only Tamil will be left. On the  usage of Tamil by the Brahmins, he stated that the Tamil spoken by the other  Andhras and the Malayali people was far better than the Tamil spoken by the Brahmins. Periyar believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the Tamil culture as a whole. With regards to a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Periyar stated that "a time will come for unity. This will go on until there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us".</br>
