<b>year 1922</b></br>
In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. 
At the session of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee held at Tiruppur in Coimbatore district he declared that Manusmriti, Ramayana and such other texts that  legitimise the Varna –Caste system be burnt to ashes. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.</br>
<b>Vaikom Satyagraha (1924–1925)</b></br>
According to the prevalent caste system in Kerala and the rest of India, low-caste Hindus were denied entry into temples. In Kerala, they were denied permission to walk on the roads that led to the temples also.
In the Kakinada meet of the Congress Party in 1923, T K Madhavan presented a report citing the discrimination faced by the depressed castes in Kerala. That session decided to promote movements against untouchability.
In Kerala, a committee was formed comprising people of different castes to fight untouchability in the region. The committee was chaired by K Kelappan; the rest of the members were T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, Kurur Neelakantan Namboodiripad and T R Krishnaswami Iyer. </br>
In early 1924, they decided to launch a <b>‘Kerala Paryatanam’</b> to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed.
In Vaikom, a small town in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of untouchability in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans, were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it.
Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha.
 T K Madhavan and K P Kesava Menon were arrested.  On 14 April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom.He was immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation.</br>
The movement gained all-India prominence and support came from far and wide. The Akalis of Punjab lend their support by setting up kitchens to provide food to the Satyagrahis. Even Christian and Muslim leaders came forward for support. This was shunned by Gandhiji who wanted the movement to be an intra-Hindu affair. On advice from Gandhiji, the movement was withdrawn temporarily in April 1924
.After Periyar’s second arrest, his wife Nagammal and his sister Kannamma kept this agitation going throughout the month of May. For her participation in the agitation,Nagammal  too was imprisoned.
 </br>
After prolonged negotiations ,a compromise was reached in November 1925 that the untouchables were allowed to use three or four roads around the temple.
For Periyar’s involvement, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee addressed him as <b>the Vaikom Veeran-Hero of Vaikom!</b></br>

<b>International travel (1929–1932)</b></br>

E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.
E.V. Ramasamy toured Malaya for a month, from December 1929 to January 1930, to propagate the self-respect philosophy. Embarking on his journey from Nagapattinam with his wife Nagammal and his followers, E.V. Ramasamy was received by 50,000 Tamil Malaysians in Penang. During the same month, he inaugurated the Tamils Conference, convened by the Tamils Reformatory Sangam in Ipoh, and then went to Singapore. In December 1931 he undertook a tour of Europe, accompanied by S. Ramanathan and Erode Ramu, to personally acquaint himself with their political systems, social movements, way of life, economic and social progress and administration of public bodies. He visited Egypt, Greece, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Germany, England, Spain, France and Portugal, staying in Russia for three months. On his return journey he halted at Ceylon and returned to India in November 1932.
The tour shaped the political ideology of E.V. Ramasamy to achieve the social concept of Self-Respect.
The communist system in the Soviet Union appealed to him as appropriately suited to deal with the social ills of the country. Thus, on socio-economic issues Periyar was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership. Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial stage of development in the Self-Respect Movement.
