<b>A few Quotes of Periyar to reiterate his beliefs</b></br>
"I talked with rustic customers and fellow merchants. I also spoke with the pious devotees and priests. These conversations generally gave shape to my anti-religion, anti-shastra, anti-purana and atheist policies. They formed the basis for my views on caste, God and religion. I also developed a general distaste for Brahminism."<i>(On his childhood days)</i></br>
"President Sir, I have lost hope that non Brahmins will get any justice from the Congress party. I am walking out of the party this very minute. Hereafter, it will be my primary goal to destroy the Congress which protects caste and Varnashrama. "
<i>(announcing his resignation from the Congress at the Kanchipuram Conference, Nov 1925)</i></br>
