<b>A few Quotes of Periyar to reiterate his beliefs</b></br>
"I talked with rustic customers and fellow merchants. I also spoke with the pious devotees and priests. These conversations generally gave shape to my anti-religion, anti-shastra, anti-purana and atheist policies. They formed the basis for my views on caste, God and religion. I also developed a general distaste for Brahminism."<i>(On his childhood days)</i></br></br>

"President Sir, I have lost hope that non Brahmins will get any justice from the Congress party. I am walking out of the party this very minute. Hereafter, it will be my primary goal to destroy the Congress which protects caste and Varnashrama. "
<i>(announcing his resignation from the Congress at the Kanchipuram Conference, Nov 1925)</i></br></br>
<b>"in the name of god, religion, and shastras you have duped us. We were the ruling people. Stop this life of cheating us from this year. Give room for rationalism and humanism. Any opposition not based on rationalism, science, or experience will one day or another, reveal the fraud, selfishness, lies and conspiracies".(Periyar to Brahmin community)
</b></br></br>
<b>“for the diffusion of useful knowledge of political education; to allow people to live a life of freedom from slavery to anything against reason and self respect; to do away with needless customs, meaningless ceremonies, and blind superstitious beliefs in society; to put an end to the present social system in which caste, religion,
  community and traditional occupations based on the accident of birth, have chained the mass of the people and created "superior" and "inferior" classes... and to give people equal rights; to completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based on brother/sisterhood; to give equal rights to women; to prevent child marriages 
  and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to conduct and encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious marriages and to have the marriages registered under the Civil Law; and to establish and maintain homes for orphans and widows and to run educational institutions.”(1952, Self Respect Movement)</b></br>
