 <b>Periyar was a great reformer, a crusader whose legacy is still thriving in our country.</b></br></br>
The political party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam which was formed by the people part of the great Dravidar Kazhagam is still alive in Tamil Nadu contesting in elections and still carrying his principles like Anti-Brahmanism,preaching values of Tamil language and supporting eradication of caste system and untouchability.</br></br>

Periyar who once reformed his society to eradicate caste system has left behind an indelible mark in all of us. The reservation for backward classes that was created because of Periyar and his agitations is still prevalent in the country. A person's individual progress and his occupation should not be determined by what caste he belongs to, but his talent and the effort he puts into.</br>
Periyar's views and thoughts are still restored in his books, articles that offer us knowldege about the society he lived in, what actions were taken by him to improve the society to motivate us to become a better person and to make our society a better place for all.</br> 

Periyar is remembered for the Self Respect Movement to redeem the identity and self-respect of Tamilians.His ideals not just uplifted Tamils but left  behind legacy for the society.
He was against the dominance of any one religion and believed in socialism which is the need for building the modern India,which needs to be unpolluted by caste system.</br></br>
He stood for social equality, self-respect, and linguistic pride which should be inculcated in the society and in the youth to help self upliftment which in-turn helps in uplifting the country .
As a social reformer, he focused on social, cultural and gender inequalities which is the base for a strong undivided unified India which should be independent from the matters of faith, gender and tradition.</br></br>
He argued that women needed to be independent, not mere child-bearers, and insisted that they be allowed a equal share in employment which we can see in the youth in today’s modern India where women empowerment is considered an important matter.</br>
He promoted weddings without rituals, and sanctioned property as well as divorce rights for women. He appealed to people to give up the caste suffix in their names, and to not mention caste. He instituted inter-dining with food cooked by Dalits which has formed the base for the reshaped India.
The youth ,who form the immediate society ,is reshaped with these self esteem values and social empowerment .With the abolition of social discrimination ,India as a whole can stand strong to fight against the social evils .These core values make the society a strong undivided unified society such that the country as a whole becomes unstoppable!
