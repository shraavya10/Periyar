<b>Self-respect</b></br></br>
Periyar wanted an ideal and a perfect world that was a universally accepted one.
As  human beings, we always scrutinise,examine all human actions. We are curious beings who inquire everything we do and see and we do not agree or do something that is unreasonable.
Using self respect, he stated that human actions should be guided through reason. What is right and what is wrong and the conclusions inferred should be from reason.</br>
Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions that are considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'.  
He preached that the Brahmins had  cheated other communities for decades and deprived them of self-respect. He stated that most Brahmins claimed to belong to a "superior" community with the reserved privilege of being in charge of temples and performing archanas and rituals. He felt that they were trying to reassert their control over religion by using their superior caste status and to claim the privilege to touch idols.
 </br></br>
<b>Social reform and eradication of caste</b></br></br>
He wanted the Government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and  adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a Government is to run the social organisation efficiently.
He told that social progress was important and that Hindu religion was unsuitable for it. The Government was not at all there for the people. 
Periyar wanted to uplift and improve the rural communities.   At that time, the distinction between rural and urban had meant an economic and social degradation for rural inhabitants. Periyar wanted to eradicate the concept of "village" as a discrimination word among places. He wanted to remove the concept of "outcast" among social groups too. He made sure neither the name nor the situation that was there or the  conditions create differences among people .He worked for the modernisation of villages by providing public facilities such as schools, libraries, radio stations, roads, bus transport, and police stations.</br></br>
 Periyar felt that a small number of cunning people created caste distinctions to dominate in the  Indian society, so he pointed out  that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse theory,plans and actions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that the caste system had been oppressing  self-respect and therefore he or she would strive to get rid of this “menace”. 
He believed that the ‘superior’ Brahmins were Aryans who descended from the North and were oppressing the local Dravidians. He believed that equality would  become a reality only if the caste system was eradicated.
So because of his movements, agitations, the Government amended the Constitution to protect the rights of the oppressed and reservation was introduced to the backward classes.
