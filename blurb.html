Periyar was a radical advocate of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun and stop supporting brahmanism.</br>
In 1920, when the Justice Party came to power, Brahmins occupied about 70 percent of the high level posts in the government. After reservation was introduced by the Justice Party, it reversed that style, allowing non-Brahmins to rise in the government of the Madras Presidency. Periyar who was a supporter of Non-Brahmins, questioned the dominance of Brahmins which had created an imbalance in the society. His Self-Respect Movement adopted rationalism and atheism and the movement had adopted anti-Brahminism.</br>

<i>Periyar stated that: "Our Dravidian movement does not exist against the Brahmins or the Banias (a North Indian merchant caste). If anyone thinks so, I would only pity him. But we will not tolerate the ways in which Brahmanism and the Bandiaism is degrading Dravidanadu. Whatever support they may have from the government, neither myself nor my movement will be of cowardice".</i></br>

In Hinduism, Periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book or origins, but an imaginary faith preaching the "superiority" of the Brahmins, the inferiority of the Shudras, and the untouchability of the Dalits.
In 1955 Periyar was arrested for his public action of burning pictures of Rama in public places as a symbolic protest against the Indo-Aryan domination and degradation of the Dravidian leadership according to the Ramayana epic.</br>
