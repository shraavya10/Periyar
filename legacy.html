<b>Legacy left behind by Periyar: Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam...</b></br></br>
In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, established a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation.This was due to differences between the two, while Periyar wanted a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, at the same time to have increased state independence, but did not wish for Tamil Nadu to become a separate State, completely cut off from India.
 E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the atrocities in the Indian subcontinent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose that sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammayar who was the daughter of Kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK.</br>
 Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the theory that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned.The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.</br></br>

<b>Social Legacy</b></br>
Periyar’s greatest impact on Tamil and Indian society is because of his anti-caste and reservation campaigns. Because of his agitations, the Government amended the Constitution to protect the rights of the oppressed and reservation was introduced for the backward classes in fields like the Government itself and in the education field like schools and colleges. 
In Tamil Nadu, the percentage of reservation has been gradually increasing over the years. Now, it is at 69%.
The Mandal Commission report implementation in 1990 and the 93rd constitutional amendment in 2005 have increased quotas for non-Brahmins nationwide. Thus Periyar’s legacy is still prevalent in India.
Though caste divisions are still present in many places, one visible effect of Periyar’s anti-caste campaign is the almost complete absence of caste based surnames in Tamil Nadu.</br>
<b>Literary Legacy</b></br>
Periyar has written many books,pamphlets, articles in magazines like Kudi Arasu and Viduthalai. A lot of his works are still in print or have been digitized. He expressed his views and thoughts on many subjects.  His language is quite blunt.
As a publisher, he introduced certain reforms in the Tamil script to make it easier to print Tamil. 
Periyar’s ideas have  inspired many writers and artists in Tamil Nadu.</br>
