<b>Self Respect Movement or the Dravidian Movement(1952)</b></br>

"When we started the  Self-Respect Movement, we had five basic goals-- to destroy God, religion,Gandhi, Congress and the Brahmin."</br>
                                       <p style="text-align:center"> - Periyar, In his last public speech</p></br>
Using self respect, he stated that human actions should be guided through reason. What is right and what is wrong and the conclusions inferred should be from reason.Self respect is freedom that is the  respect to thoughts and actions that are considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason' and the application of rationalism.  
It was founded in 1925 by S. Ramanathan who invited E. V. Ramasamy to lead  the movement in Tamil Nadu, India against Brahmanism.</br>
Periyar and his followers campaigned constantly to influence and pressure the government to take measures to remove social inequality,(abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc). The Self-Respect Movement was described from the beginning as "dedicated to the goal of giving non-Brahmins a sense of pride based on their Dravidian past".</br>
<b>In 1929, he dropped ‘Naicker ’, his caste based surname from his name.</b></br>
<b>In 1952,</b> the Periyar Self-Respect Movement Institution was registered with a list of objectives of the institution from which may be quoted as
<i><b>“for the diffusion of useful knowledge of political education; to allow people to live a life of freedom from slavery to anything against reason and self respect; to do away with needless customs, meaningless ceremonies, and blind superstitious beliefs in society; to put an end to the present social system in which caste, religion, community and traditional occupations based on the accident of birth, have chained the mass of the people and created "superior" and "inferior" classes... and to give people equal rights; to completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based on brother/sisterhood; to give equal rights to women; to prevent child marriages and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to conduct and encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious marriages and to have the marriages registered under the Civil Law; and to establish and maintain homes for orphans and widows and to run educational institutions.”</i></b></br>
The objective was not just to introduce social reform but to bring about a social revolution to uphold and encourage a new spirit and build a new society.
Periyar formed the Self Respect Socialist Party[Surya Mariyadhai Samadharma Katchi] which was to promote socialism. </br>
He came up with <b>‘Erode Programme’ </b>to outline the new movement’s goals which were:</br>
* Debts of farmers should be immediately written off and steps taken to prevent them from falling into debt again.</br>
* Usury should be banned and banks that provide loans against lands  should be opened in large numbers.</br>
* Land ownership through benamis should be banned.</br>
* The government should eliminate middlemen and make arrangements for the farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers.</br>
* Plans should be drawn up to provide education to all within a specified period.
* Prohibition should be enforced.</br>
* Appropriate measures should be taken to abolish untouchability and other superstitions.</br>

<b>Justice Party(1938–1944)</b></br>
A political party known as the South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose the economic and political power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to give social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes.The reason of formation of Justice Party was to get equal justice due to caste issues.</br>
 
In 1937, when the government required that Hindi be taught in the school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played a big role in the politics of Tamil Nadu. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage.They did not want to lose the importance of their own linguistic importance When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party  .The slogan “Tamil Nadu for Tamilians”was first used by E.V. Ramasamy in protest against the introduction of Hindi in schools.He was jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his guardianship the party prospered.
In 1939, E.V. Ramasamy became the head of the Justice Party.</br>
<b>Dravidar Kazhagam (1944–onwards)</b></br>
At a rally in 1944, Periyar, in his capacity as the leader of the Justice Party, declared that the party would henceforth be known as the Dravidar Kazhagam, or "Dravidian Association"The Dravidar Kazhagam came to be well known among the urban communities and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack.From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.</br>
