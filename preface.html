<p> <font size=4>You may be wondering as to why have I chosen this personality for my work .At this raw age of 13,I got addicted to the society and it’s reformers.It all started as part of my school project,which later ignited the spark in me to take up this huge responsibility of writing a biography on “Periyar” ,E V Ramasamy. Coming from the South Indian state of Karnataka and also from a Hindu Brahmin family ,I was drawn in to reading Periyar’s life and work.What attracted me the most is his values and principles that laid foundation and the stepping stone for the formation of new Tamil era.As I went on reading more and more facts on him,I got to know how big a leader was he in Tamilnadu and how much influence he has through his ideologies and rationalism even today in Tamilnadu as the forefather of Dravidar Kazhagam  party.His principles reshaped Tamilnadu politics.
He is the real leader of the society and rationalist social reformer who died 45 years ago and still so dear to so many people,specifically the Tamil society.
